<h1><b>Employee Management System</b></h1>
<p>An ASP.NET MVC application for managing employee leave and sick leave requests with role-based access control.</p>

<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
<p>This system is built with ASP.NET MVC and SQL Server, using Individual Accounts for authentication and role management. There are two user roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Employee:</b> Can submit leave and sick leave requests.</li>
  <li><b>HR:</b> Has full <b>CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)</b> control over employees and can manage leave balances.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both Employees and HR users can request leave, while HR employees can adjust annual and bonus leave days for employees as needed.</p>
